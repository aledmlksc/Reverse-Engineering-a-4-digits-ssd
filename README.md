# Reverse-Engineering-a-4-digits-ssd
Using Aduino Uno and Python scripts to let a tiny 4 digits seven segments displays what we want.


## What ?

The projects contains two scripts.The Arduino handle the process of displaying the write number on each digit based on a data collected befor.
The data is collected be the Python script from a simple UI , (do not accepts strings only numirical expritions) then it is send sirially to the Arduino.
This is just a simple explanation but we get into the hard stuff later.
